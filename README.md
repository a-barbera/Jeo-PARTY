# Project Structure:
After narrowing down our theme of choice to focus on the popular game show "Jeopardy" using data from the show from 1984-2012, we first created a simplistic website wireframe to plan out how we wanted to visually organize our data.  We chose to make a multi-page site with a home page that could take users to either a playable game of Jeopardy, an interactive map to see where some of the top winners have come from, or a statistics page with interactive and informative charts regarding some Jeopardy show facts from over the years.

This project can be recreated on a local server and is also hosted [here](#).
